# Guidelines

Winter is coming. We want to build a program to handle our gift list, mark items as bought and eventually find some inspiration from an external website like Etsy.

# Step 1 - The menu loop
Start by building the main loop displaying the actions and getting user’s input.

# Step 2 - List, Add, Delete
Now let’s implement the simple actions (list, add, delete).

- How do you model your gift_list?
- Do you use a hash? An array?

# Step 3 - Mark an item as bought
We want to be able to mark any item as bought.

- How do you modify your gift_list to store the status of each item?
- How does it affect your code?

# Step 4 - Find ideas on Etsy
You are out of ideas for Christmas and you want to find inspiration from Etsy.

Add a new action idea to your menu (additionally to the list, add, delete and mark actions).

# [OPTIONAL] Save gifts in a CSV file
We want to be able to retrieve the gift list any time we launch the app.

Create a file gifts.csv to persist your data locally.
